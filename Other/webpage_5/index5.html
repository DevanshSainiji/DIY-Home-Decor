                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Do you like collecting beautiful glasses and adding them to your endless collection? I absolutely love them. But because I'm a bit clumsy, I often break glasses. It's really disappointing because I just can't find any suitable glasses to complete my existing sets. And these glasses are expensive. You can probably imagine that if you like collecting glasses yourself. <br><br>

                    I've decided to hold off on buying these expensive glasses, but I'm going to keep collecting them anyway. You might wonder, why is she is contradicting herself now? I've found a hack that makes both possible, and I'm about to share it with you all. I've set out to create my own range using DIY techniques. <br><br>
                    
                    Yes, it might take up your free time, but don't you want to have some classy glassware in your cupboard? I've looked for them on several online sites like Amazon and IKEA, but the stuff is really expensive. You'll feel a sense of satisfaction when you design your own range. Plus, you might just fall in love with these DIY techniques and keep using them over time. <br><br>
                    
                    The latest trend in glasses is gold rimmed drinking glasses. They were very popular in the 90s, and the trend is back. Since I decided to downsize my budget for my desires, I'm going to make easy DIY gold rimmed cocktail glasses. <br><br>
                    
                    So, how to paint gold rimmed glasses? The DIY gold rimmed glasses can be obtained by following these 8 simple steps.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="width: 20%; background-color: rgb(243, 229, 203); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; height: fit-content;">
                <h3>Materials</h3>
                <p>Glass</p>
                <p>Golden glass paint</p>
                <p>Plate</p>
                <p>Duct tape</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="lower">
            <h3>Step 1 - Stick adhesive tape to the glass</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_1.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>We don't plan on painting the entire glass gold, so wrap some tape around the glass, leaving only a small part of the rim free. This will give you a symmetrical outline.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2 - Wrapped Glass</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_2.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Once you have wrapped the glass all around with tape, your glass will look like this.</p>

            <h3>Step 3 - Pour the paint onto a plate</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_3.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>We will not use the traditional painting technique with a brush. Instead, we will dip the upside-down glass into the paint. <br>

                There are two reasons why we use this technique <br>
                
                1) It saves a lot of time. <br>
                
                2) It creates an even layer of colour over the glass' entire edge. <br>
                
                The latter is the main reason for dipping into the paint.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4 - Place the rim of the glass on the plate</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_4.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Now, the rim of the glass is dipped into the plate filled with golden glass paint.</p>

            <h3>Step 5 - Let the paint drip off</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_5.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Remove the jar from the paint and leave it upside down for a few minutes to allow the paint to drip off and dry thoroughly.</p>

            <h3>Step 6 - Wait for the paint to dry</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_6.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Once the excess paint has dripped off, let the glass dry for a few hours.</p>

            <h3>Step 7 - Remove the tape</h3>
            <img src="./image_1/image_7.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Carefully remove the tape from the glass when the paint is completely dry. Be careful not to let the tape take off the paint.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 8 - The glass with the gold rim is now ready for use</h3>
