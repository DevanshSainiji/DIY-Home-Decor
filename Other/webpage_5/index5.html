                <h3>Materials</h3>
                <p>Faucet</p>
                <p>Wood plank</p>
                <p>Bulb</p>
                <p>Cable</p>
                <p>Drill/silicon</p>
                <p>Screws</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Gather the materials</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_1.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>It is advisable to start any DIY projects by gathering the materials. With materials in your workstation, you don’t have to run around for the materials. For making a DIY faucet lamp, you will need a faucet (you can get something like I am using from thrift market or vintage shops), a wood plank (to fit the faucet on it, and then to the wall), a bulb (you may opt for Edison lamp, it will enhance the beauty of your DIY industrial lamp using faucet), electrical cable, drill/silicon, and a few screws.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Drill the wood to fit the faucet</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_2.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Take the measurement of the faucet pipe that will be inserted through the hole drilled into the wood plank. Mark the measurement on the wood plank. Using a drill, make a hole in the wood plank to fit the faucet. Clean the wood plank of dust and sand the hole to smooth it with sandpaper.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Check the hole drilled</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_3.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Check the hole you drilled by inserting the faucet. The faucet should fit perfectly into the hole.<br><br>

                <strong></strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> It’s crucial to take the correct measurement to drill the hole. If it is a small hole, the faucet pipe won’t pass through it. If it is a large hole, the faucet will not fit properly. The hole should be of exact measurement. However, you can use sealant to seal and fix the faucet pipe tightly with the hole if it is slightly larger than the faucet pipe.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Fit the faucet in the wood plank</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_4.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Fit the faucet into the hole drilled in the wood plank. Refer to the image to see how you should fit the faucet into the hole of the wood plank.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: It's time to insert the electrical cable</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_5.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>The electrical cable should run out from the faucet. So, you have to insert the cable from the other side of the hole drilled into the wood plank and make the cable come out of the faucet as water comes out of it. You will have to open the upper part of the faucet to make the cable run out of it. Check the image to clarify the step.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Here's how to insert the electrical cable</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_6.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Here's how your DIY industrial lamp will look once you have made the cable pass through it.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Fit the bulb holder in the DIY faucet lamp</h3>

            <p>Fit a bulb holder to fix the bulb on the faucet end of the DIY faucet lamp.

            <h3>Step 8: Connect the cable and fix the wood plank</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_8.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Connect the electrical cable to the wall socket. Remember to keep the "switch off" when connecting the DIY faucet lamp's electrical cable with the wall socket's electrical wiring. Now, fix the wood plank to the wall. Use the drill to drill holes in the four corners of the wood plank for the screws. Tighten the screws with a screwdriver.</p>

            <h3>Step 9: Fit the electrical bulb</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_9.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Fit a bulb to the holder hanging on the cable of the DIY industrial lamp.</p>

            <h3>Step 10: Switch it on</h3>
            <img src="./image_5/image_10.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Switch on the light.</p>

            <h3>Step 11: Here’s your DIY faucet lamp</h3>
