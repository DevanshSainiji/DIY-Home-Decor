            <h3>Step 1: Choose a Long Wooden Plank</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image1.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Select a long wooden plank that will serve as the foundation for your DIY mason jar pendant light. Ensure it's long enough to accommodate three mason jars. Position the jar lids evenly along the plank and mark their placements. <br><br>

                <strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use a measuring tape to ensure equal spacing between the mason jars. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also maintains balance and stability when suspended.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Drill Holes as Needed</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image2.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Using a drill machine, create the necessary holes. You'll need three holes for securing the mason jar lids and bulbs, and two additional holes for hanging the pendant light. <br><br>

                <strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Smooth the surface of the plank with sandpaper for a polished finish. Consider varnishing or painting the wood to enhance its appearance and durability, as it will be a prominent part of your home decor.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Enlarge Holes on the Opposite Side</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image3.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Switch the drill attachment and enlarge the holes from the opposite side to about halfway through the plank's width. These larger holes will facilitate the attachment of screws for the bulb holders. Refer to the accompanying image for visual guidance.</p>
           
            <h3>Step 4: Secure Mason Jar Covers and Bulb Holders</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image4.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Attach the mason jar lids and bulb holders securely to the plank, one by one. Ensure they are fixed from the smaller holes drilled earlier. <br> <br>

                <strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Double-check the alignment and stability of the jar lids and bulb holders to ensure they are securely fastened and properly positioned.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Attach All Three Jar Lids and Bulb Holders</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image5.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>If you're crafting a pendant light with three bulbs, affix all three jar lids and bulb holders onto the wooden plank.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Arrange Cables on the Back Side</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image6.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Organize the electrical cables on the back side of the wooden plank, ensuring they are neatly arranged and securely fastened.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Install Hangers on Both Sides</h3>
            <img src="./image_3/image7.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Thread the rope through the drilled holes to attach hangers for your DIY hanging mason jar lamp.
