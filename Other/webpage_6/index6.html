                <h3>Materials</h3>

                <p>Plant pot</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Trim the Self-Adhesive Glass</h3>
            <img src="./Image_6/image1.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Start by trimming the self-adhesive glass to match the dimensions of your chosen plant pot. Employ scissors for precise cuts, ensuring a neat finish. This glass will function as a reflective surface, injecting a hint of sophistication into your indoor garden. <br> <br>

                <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong> Measure twice, cut once! Double-check the dimensions of your plant pot before trimming the self-adhesive glass to ensure a perfect fit.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Apply the Self-Adhesive Glass</h3>
            <img src="./Image_6/image2.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Gently apply the self-adhesive glass onto the entire exterior of the plant pot. Smooth out any air bubbles to achieve seamless adherence. As the light catches this reflective surface, it will scatter and shimmer, casting a mesmerizing disco-ball effect. </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Fill with Soil</h3>
            <img src="./Image_6/image3.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>With the self-adhesive glass firmly in place, fill the plant pot with nutrient-rich soil. Opt for a premium potting mix tailored to your plant's specific requirements. Besides fostering healthy growth, the soil contributes to the overall visual appeal of your DIY disco planter.</p>
           
            <h3>Step 4: Plant Your Greenery</h3>
            <img src="./Image_6/image4.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Now, it's time to introduce your chosen plant to its new disco-themed home. Select a plant that complements the size of your planter and the conditions of your indoor environment. Whether you opt for a striking succulent, a lush pothos, or a colourful bloom, position it centrally within the pot for balanced aesthetics.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Secure with String</h3>
            <img src="./Image_6/image5.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>To transform your disco planter into a suspended masterpiece, securely fasten a string around the pot. Choose a robust string that aligns with the overall design and ensures the planter hangs at your desired height. This step adds versatility, enabling you to showcase your creation in various locations around your home.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Voila, It's Complete!</h3>
