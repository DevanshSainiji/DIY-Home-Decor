                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Inspired by traditional knotting techniques, knot pillows are among the most sought-after trends on Pinterest and in DIY home decor and interior design magazines. Modern knot pillows are most commonly used in Scandinavian decor, where they form the highlight of a room.<br><br>

                    While they don't look like a traditional pillow, they are just as comfortable and cozy. The best part is that most DIY knot pillow projects use recycled materials like blankets, sweaters, and yarn. It means YOU are saving the planet by reusing materials instead of throwing them away.<br><br>
                    
                    So, if you are also a fan of the bright and cozy look and are interested in modern Scandinavian decor, this knotless pillow is a must for everyone!<br><br>
                    
                    You can use this handmade art to beautify your home and make an excellent gift for family and friends. And if a festive season is coming soon, you have discovered the perfect DIY gift for friends and family or a piece of decor for your home.<br><br>
                    
                    The knot pillow has its origins in sailor knotting techniques. They can be done in simple and complex styles.<br><br>
                    
                    They range from the simple knot ball to the more complicated Celtic knot pillow. Once you learn the knotting technique, you can adjust the pillow depending on your use, whether as a crib pillow or a seat pillow, to support your lower back while working. That's the great thing about this pillow: it can be used in many ways.<br><br>
                    
                    In most designs, a tube is sewn from fabric and filled with filler to make a knot pillow. However, this tutorial includes instructions on how to make a knot pillow with a blanket.<br><br>
                    
                    All you need is a soft blanket and two rubber bands. You will love it as much as I do. Use the pillow to snuggle up comfortably on the sofa while relaxing and watching TV or reading in the armchair. Let's get started right away!</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Knot pillow DIY</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_1.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Let's start our tutorial. Lay your blanket on a flat surface (I put mine on the floor) and smooth out any wrinkles to make it easier to roll afterward. If you have a blanket with two sides (fluffy and smooth), place the fluffy side down so it is on the outside when you roll the blanket.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Roll up</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_2.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>We first roll up one of the longer sides of the blanket towards the middle.<br><br>

                Roll as tightly as possible!</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Roll other side</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_3.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>As soon as you reach the middle, go to the other side and roll the blanket just as firmly towards the middle.<br><br>

                Both rolls should touch each other in the middle when you have finished rolling the blanket. </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Fasten with elastic band</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_4.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>Attach a rubber band to each end of the rolled blanket to ensure it doesn't unroll again when tied.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Make a simple knot</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_5.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>We now take both ends of the rolled blanket and tie a simple knot in the middle. Make sure both roles are visible.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Loop the ends through the knot in the middle</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_6.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>In this step, we take one end of the blanket, pass it over the knot loop, and then place it over the other. Refer to the image to get more clarity on the step.<br><br>

                Once we have tied this knot, we can remove the rubber band again.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Repeat step with the other end</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_7.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>We're almost there! We now take the other end of the blanket and repeat the previous step by passing it over one side of the loop and under the other side. Refer to the image for more clarity.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 8: Sewing DIY knot pillows and knitting knot pillows</h3>
            <img src="./image_4/image_8.webp" alt="" class="large_img">
            <p>It's almost done. We now tighten the rolls to ensure they are symmetrical on both sides and hide the ends of the blanket in the knot so that they are not visible and cannot unfold.<br><br>

                And that was it! Your knot pillow is now finished and ready to use!<br><br>
                
                Now, you can put it behind your back when sitting on a chair or under your neck while lying on the couch watching a movie or reading a book. You will love how cozy it is!<br><br>
                
                <strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use a colorful blanket to make your knot pillow art and make it a highlight in the room's decor.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Note:</strong> If you use a long blanket, you may have a significant length of roll left after creating a loop.<br><br>
                
                In this case, you can repeat steps 6 and 7 and make another loop to use up the excess roll.<br><br>
                
                This will give you a larger pillow, which will also look great.</p>
